# Firebase Authentication Example for React Native

Thank you for trying the Firebase Authentication example 👏

**Please note that limited support is offered for this example though we will happily accept PRs.**

The following authentication features are ready for use in this example:

- Sign In
- Sign Out
- Create account
- Forgot Password
- Sign in with social auth providers
- Sign in with phone auth (with country selection)
- Linking social profiles
- Change Password
- Email verification
- Updating user profile

and the following providers:

- Email / Password Sign In
- Phone Auth via SMS
- Apple (Native, iOS only, PRs needed for web support)
- Facebook (Native only, PRs needed for web support)
- Google (Native only, PRs needed for web support)

This template creates an app that comes out of the box ready with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [react-native-web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) support, based on [the Luna template](https://github.com/plaut-ro/luna#readme)

## Getting started

Ensure your development environment is set up for React Native by following the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Create an app using the template

1. For a quick demonstration, this template is pre-configured with a firebase project called `ProjectName`, if you just want to see it work, run `npx react-native init ProjectName --template invertase/react-native-firebase-authentication-example
1. For a real project, replace `ProjectName` in the init command with your new project's real name, then follow the configuration instructions below

### Android: Setting up App Signing

Google Sign-In requires a `keystore` file to be added to your project and the Firebase console for both debug and release builds, we've included a `debug` one by default. To setup a new `keystore` file, follow the [guide here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#debug-mode).

### Add your Firebase credentials

1. Choose your existing Firebase project from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   > Creating a new project? Check out the React Native Firebase [documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#prerequisites).
2. Replace the native Firebase credentials template files to your project by following documentation for [Android](https://rnfirebase.io/#generating-android-credentials) and [iOS](https://rnfirebase.io/#generating-ios-credentials).
3. Copy the web config from Firebase console into `src/shims/firebase-init.ts`

### Run the app

- Start the metro javascript bundler: `yarn start`
- For android: `yarn android`
- For apple: `yarn ios`
- For web: `yarn web`
- For testing (jest): `yarn test:all`
- For linting (format, lint, typescript): `yarn lint:all`

## Authentication Providers
